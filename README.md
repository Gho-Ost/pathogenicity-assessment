## Introduction and Problem Description

The problem of assessing pathogenicity in genetic variants is a problem of classification. The classification system was created by The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP). 5 classes can be distinguished: benign, likely benign, variant of unknown significance (VUS), likely pathogenic, and pathogenic.
